# Why TypeScript?
As a React developer, you’re likely familiar with the benefits of using a statically-typed language like TypeScript. TypeScript offers a type system that helps catch errors early, making it easier to write more reliable code faster. In a React context, TypeScript can also provide additional benefits such as improved code maintainability and extensibility. If you’re new to TypeScript, it’s a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types to your code. This means that you can catch errors before your code runs, which can save you time and improve the quality of your codebase.

## ComponentProps utility type:

A common pattern in React is to create a component that takes props as an argument. TypeScript provides a utility type called ComponentProps, which automatically extracts the props type from a given component. This saves you time and helps avoid errors when defining a component’s props.

```javascript test.jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ name, age }: { name: string; age: number}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{name}</p>
      <p>{age}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

type MyComponentProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof MyComponent>;

const App = () => {
  const props: MyComponentProps = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 26,
  };

  return <MyComponent {...props} />;
};

```
_`ComponentProps`_ proves more useful when used with rest parameters and Native HTML Elements

```javascript test.jsx

import React from 'react';

function CustomButton(props: React.ComponentProps<'button'>) {
  return <button {...props}>Click me!</button>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CustomButton onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this example, we’re using the _`ComponentProps`_ utility type to define the props for a custom _`CustomButton`_ component that extends the functionality of the native button element. By passing the _`onClick`_ prop to _`CustomButton`_, we're able to handle the button click event and log a message to the console. The _`...props`_ syntax allows us to pass any additional props to the underlying button element, such as _`className`_ or _`disabled`_ and if we tried to pass an invalid prop to the _`CustomButton`_ element, Typescript will throw an error.

## Union Types:
Another useful TypeScript feature is the ability to use union types with _`useReducer`_. This allows you to define a state type that can have multiple variations. For example, you can specify the type of action and the exact payload key expected
```javascript test.jsx
import { useReducer } from "react";

type State = { count: number };

type Action =
  | { type: "add"; add: number }
  | { type: "subtract"; subtract: number };

const reducer = (state: State, action: Action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "add":
      return { count: state.count + action?.add };
    case "subtract":
      return { count: state.count - action?.subtract };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};

export const Reducer = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

  function onAdd1() {
    dispatch({ type: "add", add: 1 });
  }

  function onAdd2() { 
    dispatch({ type: "add" }); // will give error because we didn't provide a payload (add) with a number value
  }
  function onSubtract1() { 
    dispatch({ type: "SUBTRACT", subtract: 1 }); // will give error because type doesn't match
  }

  function onSubtract2() { 
    dispatch({ type: "subtract", subtract: "123" }); // will give error because payload subtract must be a number
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={onAdd1}>add</button>
      <button onClick={onAdd2}>add</button>
      <button onClick={onSubtract1}>subtract</button>
      <button onClick={onSubtract2}>subtract</button>
    </>
  );
};
```
## Excess Properties & Explicit Typing:

Finally, TypeScript provides a way to strongly type the functions returned by _`useState`_. This helps ensure that you’re using the correct type when updating the state and provide better error handling.

When you use the _`useState`_ hook in a React component with TypeScript, the type of the state is inferred based on the initial value you provide. However, when you update the state using _`setState`_, TypeScript does not perform excess property checking by default. This means that you can add additional properties to the object you pass to _`setState`_, even if they are not part of the type of the state.

Consider the code below:
```javascript test.jsx
import { useState } from "react";

interface TagState {
  tagSelected: number | null;
  tags: { id: number; value: string }[];
}

export const Tags = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<TagState>({
    tags: [],
    tagSelected: null,
  });
  return (
    <div>
      {state.tags.map((tag) => {
        return (
          <button
            key={tag.id}
            onClick={() => {
              setState((currentState) => ({
                ...currentState,
                tagselected: tag.id,
              }));
            }}
          >
            {tag.value}
          </button>
        );
      })}
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setState((currentState) => ({
            ...currentState,
            tags: [
              ...currentState.tags,
              {
                id: new Date().getTime(),
                value: "New",
                otherValue: "something",
              },
            ],
          }));
        }}
      >
        Add Tag
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
In the example above, when the Add Tag button is clicked it adds a new tag to the tags array, with properties id, value, otherValue , if the user clicked on one of the tags, the tagselected will be the tag id, there are two issues with our code, can you spot them? we added otherValue to the tags array, this property didn’t exist in our original tags type, yet typescript didn’t spot the issue. the second issue is tagselected , our original TagState interface had a property called tagSelected camel-cased, typescript didn’t spot this issue as well.

To get an error for this bug we can use explicit typing:

```javascript example.jsx
<button
      key={tag.id}
      onClick={() => {
        setState(
          (currentState): TagState => ({ //notice the change in this line
            ...currentState,
            tagselected: tag.id, // will get an error due to explicit typing
          })
        );
      }}
    >
      {tag.value}
    </button>
```
```javascript example.jsx
<button
    onClick={() => {
      setState(
        (currentState): TagState => ({ //notice the change in this line
          ...currentState,
          tags: [
            ...currentState.tags,
            {
              id: new Date().getTime(),
              value: "New",
              otherValue: "something", // will get an error due to explicit typing
            },
          ],
        })
      );
    }}
  >
```
With explicit typing in place, TypeScript will now catch the typo in tagselected and the extra property otherValue, and throw an error. By catching these errors early, we can avoid bugs and improve the reliability of our code.

To summarize, TypeScript offers several useful features for React developers, including:
- The _`ComponentProps`_ utility type, which automatically extracts the props type from a given component and helps avoid errors when defining a component’s props.
- Union types, which allow you to define a state type that can have multiple variations and provide better error handling with _`useReducer`_.
- Explicit typing with _`useState`_ functions, which helps ensure that you’re using the correct type when updating the state and catches errors early.

Explicit typing with useState functions, which helps ensure that you’re using the correct type when updating the state and catches errors early.
